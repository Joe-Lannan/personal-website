Slight realization, but the continuum models in [[Membrane Buckling forces in Spirostomum]] and [[Microtubule Energy and Forces in Spirostomum]] can instead be looked at across a single unit cell. 
Though this may be what Mary was considering when she meant a contenuum model, but I think this idea can be quite powerful in calculations
#### Local bending moduli
The separation between the microtubule network near the membrane. the membrane bucking and the myoneme being internal to the cell means that there is some bending modus in the composite material. This can be calculated from the shortening of the myoneme and comparing it to the (supposedly static) microtubule


#### Defining the unit cell
it is still strange that across a row of microtubules the one paper from Ishida does not see that the ciliary rows compact along a fiber yet we see that the myoneme shortens from the IF. It could be that the microtubules and the myoneme are not parallel, though we dont have the if to show that this is the case. Serial TEM could also solve this but both are probably not possible given when we want to submit this paper. A quick solution would be to look at the helical angles of the two. This complicates the unit cell idea a bit

#### to do 
- measure the helical angle of the myoneme to see if it is consistent with the microtubules or if the microtubule networks instead cross through a unit cell which is my current hypothesis
- Calculate bending moduli and force balance over the unit cell. 
- see if we can gain insight into the spring constants across a unit cell, see [[Spirostomum]].
