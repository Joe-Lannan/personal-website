## Overview
This paper take a top down look at how the [[Myoneme]]s cause contraction in [[Spirostomum]]. This paper will start from the large scale contraction and move down to the ultra structure, and then finally the protein scale

## Figures
### Fig 1
This figure looks at the whole scale organization of the myoneme using IF, with a focus on how they rearrange under contraction

### Fig 2 
This figure looks at modeling of the whole scale organism to better figure out how the organizational changes found by Saad/luke are able to create organism scale contraction.

### Fig 3 
This figure looks at the ultra structural changes under contraction with immunogold labeling
### Fig 4
This figure models the changes on the ultrastructure.
 -- could instead replace this with a force balance cartoon
### Fig 5
This figure looks at the protein level predictions and suggests a model for how the proteins can create the effects we see in the TEM
 - possible model figure

## Discussion
### Force Balance Calculations
Microtubule force from twisting
Using equations from Lagomarsino in Saads preprint
	comes out to be about $3E9 \cdot kT$ which is pretty small, this is the output of a muscle cell in about 25ms
The membrane calculation is much more complicated, 
	Using a sheet with a sinusoidal curve on a sheet in it we can find that the energy goes as $4 * \pi ...$ using the values from --paper-- we can find that the the energy is approximately $60 kT$ so we can ignore it.

calculations from [[Microtubule Energy and Forces in Spirostomum]] and [[Membrane Buckling forces in Spirostomum]]


### Mesh discussion
Fishnet mesh recapitulates the contraction motion, however not the twisting seen by manu's paper

### Force Balancing
[[Membrane Buckling forces in Spirostomum]] and [[Microtubule Energy and Forces in Spirostomum]] calculate the energy of the microtubules and membrane

To get a force balance of the myoneme in motion we would need to estimate the breaking force from the mt, membrane, crowding, and drag which seems a bit infeasable

Energetics picture can provide the trade off for potential energy stored in the myoneme, though with huge dissipative forces from the 

### Alphfold discussion
The alphafold predicts that spiro sfi1 is much floppier
contributes to entropic spring theory
- calculate spring constant?
	- Jerry now has some molecular dynamics simulations that could be useful for calculating spring constants from RMS distances
