## Purpose
- Colable [[Centrin]] and [[Sfi1]] to see if they colocalize

## Methods
Following closely to [[[[@Xu2019-tz]]]]

- Spiro was placed onto a glass bottom 96 well plate
- Cells were treated with Taxol for 15min
- Cells were rinsed with 1x PHEM buffer
- One well was treated with ~.05M EGTA for 1min and tapped to mix and get cells to release calcium
- Cells were then switched into %2 formaldehyde in PHEM (1x) for 15min
- Cells were rinsed with PHEM then 1% glycine (w/v) for 5min to quench 
- 3X rinses of incubation solution for ~10min with shaking on 3d shaker
- 1:100 incubation with sfi1 (1850), centrin (20h5), plus secondaries sfi1-488, centrin-657 for 1h
- cells were then put in mounting solution for imaging

## Results
- Preservation was okish, but labeling worked poorly
