in order for proteins to drastically change confirmation there must be a significant pH change, this could be measured with fluorescent dyes
Voltage fluors from Julia Martins group could also potentially used to measure a change in the cell potential.
It seems a bit unlikley that theres is a huge change in cellular pH under contraction, though perhaps a small change could cause a
