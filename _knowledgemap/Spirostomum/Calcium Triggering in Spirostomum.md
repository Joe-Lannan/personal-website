## Purpose
see if we have sufficient evidence to know that the myonemes are calcium triggered


## Personal Evidence
 - Calcium sequestration with EGTA seems to cause elongation
 - Centrin seems to be a EF hand protein
 - tcb2 is calcium triggered gel

## Literature evidence
 - Most papers seem to all conclude that it is calcium triggered or assume this as fact
- [[@Jones1967-mr]] used radiography on slices of spiro to see if they contained calcium after mixing them with certain isotopes
- Cell models
	- Probably best evidence that contraction ATP independent.
