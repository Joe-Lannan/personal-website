	Abstract  
	Fibroblasts in human conjunctiva were examined by electron microscopy. Their striated fibers were almost always associated with basal bodies or centrioles. The length and thickness of the striated fibers were variable. The average length was 0.48 +/- 0.38 (SD) micron; the maximum length was 2.1 microns. The average thickness was 62.3 +/- 26.4 (SD) nm; the maximum thickness was 157 nm. Each bundle of striated fibers consisted of several filaments of about 7 nm in diameter. The periodicity of the major crossband was 69.7 +/- 2.8 (SD) nm. At least six intraperiod subbands were seen between the electron-dense major bands. The functional significance of striated fibers was discussed.

This description is in credibly similar to [[Sfi1]] and [[Centrin]]

Apparently these fibers can be found in chlamydomonas according to [[Lil Fritz-Laylin]]
