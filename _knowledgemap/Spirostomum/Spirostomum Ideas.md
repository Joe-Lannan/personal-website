A overview of things Id like to try (or have some one else try) on [[Spirostomum]]

- Patch clamp
- Attempting western blotting to find binding (Jerry?) 
- Injection
	- Labeled Protein
	- Plasmids
	- Fluorescent Beads (mixing under contraction)
	- Magnetic particles for triggering contraction
- Healing Assays
- Immunogold TEM with Sfi1 
- Centrin tails attached to GFP. Could also be used in human cells to find localizations of the different centrins
- Fret with sfi1 in yeast or editable ciliates
- Using Micropillar arrays to measure forces of spiro contraction transmission through liquids
- Temperature dependence of contraction if the entropic spring model is correct.
- Spiro Handed-ness
-
