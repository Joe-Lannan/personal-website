Myonemes are the fibers that are believed to be responsible for contraction in [[Spirostomum]].

They are likely composed of [[Centrin]] and [[Sfi1]]. 

They can be found in a number of [[Ciliate]], though they change forms and have very different contractions among some families of ciliate.

## Whats Unknown
- The exact biomolecular basis for contraction
	- How do [[Centrin]] and [[Sfi1]] change organization
	- Are they consensates?
	- what mechanics are they relying on?
- How calcium signals contration [[Calcium Triggering in Spirostomum]]
- The mechanics for the whole cell contracting (are microtubules acting as a spring?
