## Ultrafast Cellular Contraction in *Spirostomum ambiguum*

My research investigates the biomechanical basis of the fastest cellular contraction known in biology. *Spirostomum ambiguum*, a single-celled giant protist, can contract its entire 1-4 mm body in under 5 milliseconds - faster than the blink of an eye.

### Key Discoveries

Through advanced imaging and computational analysis, I've revealed that this remarkable contraction is powered by a specialized cytoskeletal structure called the myoneme - a calcium-activated mesh of centrin-Sfi1 filaments that functions unlike any known contractile machinery.

**Fabrication:** 3D printing, electronics, machining, laser cutting
*Spirostomum* presents many unique challenges for imaging, including its ability to rapidly contract and its sensitivity to chemicals. I've developed specialized methods for fixation and imaging, and applied various image analysis techniques using ImageJ and biophysical modeling to understand force generation of the *Spirostomum* cytoskeleton. Our techniques enable visualization of the myoneme network in both contracted and elongated states, providing critical insights into the contractile mechanism.

#### Multiscale computational modeling
I performed Molecular Dynamics simulations to analyze the effects of calcium binding to the myoneme. Preliminary results showed changes in persistence length of the myoneme as measured by correlation function of angles between residues of Sfi1. I also collaborated on models of the whole organism using energy minimization with the myoneme modeled as springs. This work bridges molecular-level events with organism-scale phenomena, providing a comprehensive understanding of the contraction mechanism.

### Magnetic Tweezers Development

As part of our work on synthetic cytoskeletons, I've built and improved magnetic tweezers using multiple approaches:
- Large pointed solenoid fabricated from mu-metal for high magnetic permeability
- Novel approach using a yoke to wrap the magnetic field back on itself, achieving higher field concentration
- Quantification of forces applied to magnetic particles in different solutions
- Integration with microscopy systems for real-time force application during imaging
- Development of custom control software for precise manipulation

This technology enables the application of controlled forces to cellular components, allowing us to probe mechanical properties and simulate cytoskeletal functions in synthetic systems.

## Previous Research Experience

### Condensed Matter Physics (NCSU, Dougherty Lab)
Worked with creating organic semiconductor devices using C8-BTBT, investigating surface effects on field effect transistors. Found that initial layers exhibited changes in crystal structure when grown on a surface versus in bulk.

### Marine Biological Laboratory Projects

#### Imaging of archaea with SEM and ExM
Worked with Dyke Mullins lab to perform SEM and Expansion Microscopy imaging of understudied archaea. Produced some of the first SEM images published on these organisms.

#### Coordinated movement of snowflake yeast
Collaborated with Will Ratcliff's lab to investigate genetically modified yeast selected for clumping and multicellular-like growth. Found that coordinated movement and organization could emerge from cell entanglement without direct selection.

#### Condensate separation of rRNA in the nucleus
Worked with Cliff Brangwynne's lab to microinject labeled rRNA sequences and SARS-COVID RNA to investigate condensate dynamics of the nucleolus, showing sequence-dependent condensation importance for nucleolar organization.
