I am a biophysicist and PhD candidate at North Carolina State University in the [Elting Lab](https://physics.ncsu.edu/eltinglab/), investigating the ultrafast contraction mechanism of *Spirostomum ambiguum* - a giant single-celled organism capable of contracting in under 5 milliseconds. It is known as "the fastest cell."

## Research Focus

My research has revealed that *Spirostomum's* remarkable contraction is powered by unique calcium-activated filaments called myonemes. Through advanced imaging and computational modeling, I've discovered how these specialized structures enable the fastest cellular contraction known in biology.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Cellular biomechanics and cytoskeletal dynamics
- Advanced microscopy techniques (SEM, TEM, confocal)
- Computational modeling of biological systems
- Single-cell biophysics

## Leadership & Innovation

Beyond research, I founded and lead [Koinslot INC](http://koinslotkywy.com), developing educational gaming systems, and served as Technical Director at Sonar Applications INC for audio social media development.
