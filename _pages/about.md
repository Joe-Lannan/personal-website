# About Me

I am a biophysicist and PhD candidate at North Carolina State University, currently finishing my doctoral research in the [Elting Lab](https://physics.ncsu.edu/eltinglab/). My research focuses on investigating the cytoskeleton of *Spirostomum ambiguum*, often called "the fastest cell" due to its ability to contract its giant single-celled body in the blink of an eye.

## Research Interests

My research has discovered that *Spirostomum's* remarkable contraction is due to unique filaments known as the myoneme that allow it to contract without using traditional contractile machinery. We found that the myoneme mesh is calcium-activated, and through shortening of its filaments, it's able to recapitulate the organism's shape change. I've been investigating the molecular basis for myonemeal force generation using various advanced imaging and computational techniques.

Beyond my core research, I've gained extensive experience with:
* Electron microscopy (SEM, TEM)
* Immuno-TEM imaging
* Confocal fluorescence microscopy
* Advanced computational modeling
* Magnetic tweezing

## Entrepreneurial Experience

In addition to my academic work, I am the founder and president of [Koinslot INC](http://koinslotkywy.com), a company producing a nostalgic gaming system for educational purposes. I've also worked as the Technical Director for Sonar Applications INC, developing an audio social media app.
