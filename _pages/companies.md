[Koinslot](http://koinslotkywy.com) is a company I co-founded to produce a nostalgic gaming system with a focus on education. We've received initial funding and have contracted with Betabox INC to use our system in educational settings.

### My Role: President and Technical Director

As the technical lead and co-founder, I'm responsible for:
- Designing the hardware for our retro gaming system
- Managing the programming and technical team
- Overseeing product development and education integration

### Company Mission

Our mission is to provide an affordable and easily programmable educational system to engage K-12 students in hardware and embedded programming. The open-source design makes it ideal for teaching both programming and electronics concepts in a way that excites students through gaming.

[Sonar Applications](https://www.sonarmobileapp.com) was an audio-focused social media application I developed with my brother, Ethan Lannan. The app reached approximately 1,000 beta testers before the project was temporarily paused to pursue Koinslot.

### My Role: Technical Director

As Technical Director, I:
- Led development of the app architecture
- Managed technical implementation
- Coordinated testing and user feedback loops

### Project Status

While currently on hold, we are exploring potential market pivots to better position the Sonar concept in today's social media landscape. The project demonstrated successful user acquisition and engagement, providing valuable insights for future development.

## Technical Leadership

Beyond founding these companies, I've held technical leadership positions in several organizations where I've managed teams and worked with non-technical leadership to produce products and services. I specialize in:

- Product development for educational technology
- Hardware design and prototyping
- Open-source technology development
- Blending academic research with practical applications

I'm passionate about creating technology that's repairable, accessible, and educationally valuable. My entrepreneurial work complements my academic research by applying scientific principles to real-world problems and opportunities.
