## Overview
Since there is not direct protein editing, we can instead try getting a bit more creative with how we pull down proteins

## Gel Exploration
The ability of these proteins to form gels may be a good way to get them to be purified out. One way this could work is by adding Ca to get it to gel and spin down the solids in an ultra-centrifuge, add egta in new solution to get it to go back into solution -> remove solids that then spin out, repeat to get purified protein out and run westerns and stuff to confirm.

## Reconstructions
This has been worked on a bit by [[Jerry Honts]]. There have been some Sfi1 constructs but they are not fully complete. They could potentially be improved with longer reads like in the [[@Zhang2023-xb]] paper but they have not made their data available. We do however have centrin isolates.
