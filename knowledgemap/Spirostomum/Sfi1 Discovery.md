It was a bit hard to pinpoint the discovery of [[Sf1]], but it appears to have been discovered in yeast 1999 by Ma et al in [[@maDeletionSFI1Novel1999]]. This is where the name was coined

It was later shown to bind to centrin by [[@kilmartinSfi1pHasConserved2003]]. This paper also identifies the relation to the spasmonyme proteins and is a great read. 

The discovery of the myoneme and extraction of the sfi1 contained therein predates the discovery of the yeast proteins which still remains a bit of a mystery.
